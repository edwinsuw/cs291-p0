                  <td>USA</td>
                  <td>The rare breed is a great choice for first-time owners because of its calm, sweet nature. Young children, however, are not recommended to care for them since they are shy and may bite if not handled gently. With a great grooming routine and healthy diet, the American rabbit can live up to 12 years.                </td>

                  <td>Tracing its roots back to the 18th century, the Belgian Hare is one of the oldest breeds. It thrives best outdoors with ample space and hay. It's considered high maintenance, mostly due to its nervous personality â€” known to easily spook if people don't properly announce themselves before approaching it.                </td>

                  <td>Originating from France, the Blanc de Hotot can easily be spotted by its "black eyeliner" that contrasts the rest of its white body. As a bonus, these bunnies do well with children and other pets as long as they grow up with them. Dedicated brushing time and taking walks outside are amazing ways to bond with them.                </td>
